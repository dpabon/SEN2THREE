Description: Sen2Three: Sentinel 2 Level 3 Processor for Spatio Temporal Synthesis
        ===================================================================================================
        Sen2Three is a level 3 processor for the spatio temporal synthesis of bottom atmospheric
        corrected level 2A (or alternatively) uncorrected top of atmosphere level 1C images, retrieved
        by the Sentinel 2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI).
        
        The key functionality of the level 3 spatio temporal synthesis algorithm is to generate a synthetic
        output image of a certain geographical area (a tile), using time series of input images of the area
        and replacing step by step all "bad" pixels of the output with "good" ones. The criteria "good" and
        "bad" will more precised in the following. Input images are a collection of Level-2A
        products acquired sequentially during a certain time period.
