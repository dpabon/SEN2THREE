Sen2Three: Sentinel 2 Level 3 Processor for Spatio Temporal Synthesis
===================================================================================================

Sen2Three is a level 3 processor for the spatio temporal synthesis of bottom atmospheric
corrected level 2A (or alternatively) uncorrected top of atmosphere level 1C images, retrieved
by the Sentinel 2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI).

The key functionality of the level 3 spatio temporal synthesis algorithm is to generate synthetic
output images of a certain geographical area, using time series of input images of the area
delivering a cloud-free product in the end. The process of synthesis uses as input a collection of
products, acqired sequentially during a time period and replaces step by step cloud-covered pixels
by clear sky pixels until a configurable threshold is reached.

Sen2Three requires the Scene Classification generated by Sen2Cor as a necessary preprocessing step.
Input products are thus Level-2A input products as generated by Sen2Cor.
